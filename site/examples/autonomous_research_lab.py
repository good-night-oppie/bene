"""
Autonomous Research Lab — Multi-Agent ML Experiment Orchestration
=================================================================

Inspired by Karpathy's autoresearch (https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch):
one agent, one GPU, modify train.py, run 5-min experiments, keep or discard.

This example scales that pattern with BENE: run N research agents in parallel,
each isolated in its own VFS, each exploring a different research direction,
with centralized experiment tracking via SQL.

What autoresearch does with git commit/reset, BENE does with formal checkpoints.
What autoresearch tracks in a TSV file, BENE tracks in a SQL-queryable database.
What autoresearch runs as one agent, BENE runs as many — isolated, auditable,
portable.

The pattern:
  1. Define a base training script (train.py)
  2. Spawn N research agents, each with a different research direction
  3. Each agent modifies the script, runs an experiment, evaluates the result
  4. If the metric improves → checkpoint and keep. If not → restore and try again.
  5. Query all agents' results with SQL to find the best experiment across all directions.

Usage:
    uv run python examples/autonomous_research_lab.py
