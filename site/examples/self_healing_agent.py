"""
Self-Healing Agent
==================

Demonstrates BENE checkpoint/restore for safe, rollback-able agent execution.

The pattern:
  1. Write initial code to the agent's VFS
  2. Checkpoint the known-good state
  3. Let the agent attempt a risky refactor
  4. If it fails → restore to the checkpoint (other agents unaffected)
  5. Inspect the full event timeline to understand what happened

This is impossible with shared-filesystem agents — you can't roll back one
agent without affecting others.

Usage:
    uv run python examples/self_healing_agent.py
