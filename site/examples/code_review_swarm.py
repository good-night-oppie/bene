"""
Code Review Swarm
=================

Four agents review the same code from different angles — security, performance,
style, and test coverage — all running in parallel with full isolation.

Each reviewer writes its findings to its own VFS. At the end, we query the
aggregate stats to see which reviewer used the most tokens and which tool calls
failed (if any).

Usage:
    uv run python examples/code_review_swarm.py
