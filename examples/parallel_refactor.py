"""
Parallel Refactor
=================

Three agents work on the same codebase simultaneously — tests, implementation,
and documentation — each fully isolated in their own VFS.

Demonstrates:
  - Parallel agent execution with Tier model routing
  - Querying aggregate stats across all agents (token usage, timing, errors)
  - How isolation prevents agents from stepping on each other

Usage:
    uv run python examples/parallel_refactor.py
